# Joke Telling Application

For my application I did a joketelling app that utlized a joke api. The goal here was to create an app to give a few good laughs all mixed with a comical background and while also displaying some react skills.

## Instructions

The application is fairly concise and simple.

First fork this repository. 
Then run "git clone [your forked link]" in yout git command line.
Next run "yarn start" to run the application in a browser.

Once in the browser, the "click for a joke" button will render a joke. To see the punchline, click "punchline".
